# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI for Humanity website project that appears to be in early development stages. The repository currently contains documentation from the AI for Humanity Track of the 2025 Global Digital Collaboration (GDC) Conference, which serves as the foundational content for the website.

## Repository Structure

The repository is minimal and contains:
- `pdf/` - Contains conference documentation
  - `GDC AI For Humanity Track Report - v2.0.pdf` - Comprehensive report covering five key AI themes: Responsible AI, Model Collaboration, AI Maturity and Evaluation, Social and Economic Impact, and Agentic AI

## Content Architecture

The website should be structured around the five key themes from the AI for Humanity program:

1. **Responsible AI** - Ethics, trust, safety, frameworks, and governance tools
2. **Model Collaboration** - Open models, data accessibility, and collaborative development  
3. **AI Maturity and Evaluation** - Assessment frameworks, benchmarking, and standards
4. **Social and Economic Impact** - Labor implications, equity, access, and climate considerations
5. **Agentic AI** - Autonomous AI systems, trust protocols, and security frameworks

## Key Organizations and Collaborators

The project involves multiple organizations:
- Global Open Source Innovation Meetup (GOSIM)
- Linux Foundation / LF AI & Data
- Generative AI Commons
- FINOS (Financial Industry Network for Open Source)
- IEEE Standards Association
- ITU (International Telecommunication Union)
- World Economic Forum
- Various academic institutions and research organizations

## Collaboration Channels

The project uses groups.io for collaboration:
- Main track: `https://globaldigitalcollaboration.groups.io/g/GDC-AIForHumanity`
- Topic-specific subgroups for each of the five themes
- Email-based collaboration and discussion

## Development Guidelines

### Content Management
- Focus on the five core AI for Humanity themes
- Maintain connections to global collaboration initiatives
- Ensure accessibility and international perspectives
- Include practical frameworks and tools, not just theoretical content

### Technical Considerations
- No existing build system or package management detected
- Project appears to be starting from scratch
- Consider modern web technologies for accessibility and global reach
- Prepare for multi-language support given international scope

### Important Frameworks to Reference

1. **Responsible Generative AI Framework (RGAF)** - 9 core dimensions
2. **Model Openness Framework (MOF)** - 3-class system for AI model openness
3. **Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP)** - Infrastructure-level trust protocol
4. **Content Credentials & C2PA Standard** - Digital content provenance
5. **FINOS AI Governance Framework** - Financial services AI governance

## Common Development Tasks

Since this is an early-stage project, common tasks will likely include:

- Setting up modern web development framework
- Creating responsive, accessible website structure
- Implementing content management for the five AI themes
- Building collaboration features for global community
- Integrating with groups.io or similar collaboration platforms
- Creating multilingual support infrastructure
- Implementing security best practices for a public-facing site

## Key Resources

- Conference report PDF contains detailed implementation guidance
- Multiple open-source frameworks and tools referenced throughout
- Strong emphasis on global collaboration and open standards
- Focus on practical, implementable solutions rather than theoretical discussions

## Notes

- This project emphasizes defensive security and responsible AI development
- Global accessibility and inclusion are core principles
- The website should serve as a hub for ongoing collaboration, not just information display
- Consider integration with existing collaboration platforms and standards organizations
